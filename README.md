## Express Portfolio
An Express app that is currently running as my portfolio on my [main website](www.grantwasil.com)

## Motivation
This was project six of the TeamTreehouse Fullstack JavaScript tech-degree. I loved it so much that I made it into my main website.


## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)

## Features
The website itself is a framework that all of my future projects can easily be added into by just updating the data file found at "data.json"
